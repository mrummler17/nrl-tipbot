# NRL TipBot

Codex-managed NRL tipping dashboard with weekly verified round notes, charity bet tracking, and static GitHub Pages deployment.

Live site: https://mrummler17.github.io/nrl-tipbot/

## What It Does

NRL TipBot is a static weekly command board for:

- NRL round previews, wraps, and tip confidence
- Official-source team news and late-mail notes
- Charity betting discipline and ledger tracking
- A compact live-round tracker for results and validation notes
- GitHub Pages publishing from a generated `index.html`

The app started as a single prototype file and now keeps content, live round data, and presentation separated so weekly updates are easier to review.

## Current Snapshot

- Round: Round 12, 2026
- Tip result: 5 from 5
- Charity bet status: no Round 12 bet placed
- Charity ledger: 2-2, $25.00 invested, $21.50 returned, -$3.50 profit
- Validation rule: do not change the Round 12 result or charity ledger without re-checking official NRL scores and the betting log

```

## Update Workflow

1. Edit `data/briefing.json` for the durable board content.
2. Edit `data/live-round.json` for current round status, sources, alerts, and results.
3. Validate the JSON:

   ```bash
   node -e 'JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync("data/briefing.json","utf8")); JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync("data/live-round.json","utf8")); console.log("json ok")'
   ```

4. Build the static output:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Sync the generated page to the GitHub Pages entry file:

   ```bash
   cp dist/index.html index.html
   ```

6. Check the result locally, then commit and push `main`.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run build     # Generate dist/index.html and dist/README.md
npm run sync      # Alias for the same generator
npm run snapshot  # Alias for the same generator
```

Optional local preview:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/index.html`.

## Deployment

GitHub Pages serves the root `index.html`, not `dist/index.html`.

Always run the build and copy `dist/index.html` to `index.html` before pushing. A successful push to `main` should trigger the Pages build for:

## Data Discipline

- Treat NRL tips and charity bets as separate records.
- Do not retrospectively count an unplaced lean as a charity bet.
- Keep the Mark Hughes Foundation ledger factual and conservative.
- Re-check official NRL sources before publishing a round preview, wrap, or result correction.
- Keep `HANDOVER.md` current before risky changes, deploys, or long context-heavy sessions.
